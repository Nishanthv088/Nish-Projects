# Sales & Revenue Forecasting for a Retail Business
Sales & Revenue Forecasting for a Retail Business
Project Overview :
This project aims to forecast weekly sales for a retail business using historical data. The analysis helps in understanding sales trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of external factors like holidays. The insights are visualized using Power BI to aid decision-making.

Dataset :
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle - Walmart Sales Forecasting Dataset and includes:
Sales Data: Weekly sales for different stores and departments.
Features Data: CPI, fuel price, temperature, and unemployment rate.
Stores Data: Store types and sizes.
Holiday Data: Identifies holiday weeks.

Project Workflow :

1. Data Collection & Cleaning :
Merged sales, store, and feature data.
Removed missing values and handled outliers.

2️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

Sales trends over time.
Impact of holidays and external factors on sales.
Store-wise and department-wise sales distribution.

3️. Time Series Forecasting (Prophet Model) :

Trained a Facebook Prophet model to predict sales.
Evaluated forecast accuracy (90.16%).
Analyzed forecast error.

4️. Power BI Dashboard :

Actual vs. Forecasted Sales - Comparison of real and predicted sales.
Store & Department-wise Performance - Best-performing stores and departments.
Sales Trends & Seasonal Patterns - Year-over-year sales trends.
Forecast Accuracy & Error Analysis - Model performance evaluation.

Key Insights :
 Holidays impact sales significantly, with spikes in holiday weeks.
 Certain stores consistently perform better based on size and location.
 Seasonal trends exist, with peaks during specific months.
 Forecast model achieves ~90.16% accuracy, indicating reliable predictions.

Technologies Used :
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, FB Prophet)
Power BI (Visualization & Dashboarding)
Excel (Data Cleaning & Exploration)
